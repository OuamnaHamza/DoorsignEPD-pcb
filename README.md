ESP-WROOM-32 breakout board to connect it to a Waveshare E-Ink display.

Inspired by article [Ausdauernde Infotafel](https://ct.de/yrzv) from German
computer magazine [c't](https://ct.de). Example arduino and server software can
be found [here](https://github.com/jamct/DoorsignEPD/).

Input voltage is connected to a voltage regulator jack and directly to
Pin6/IO34/ADC6 for monitoring. Hence input voltage must be below 3.6V.  I use
2xAA together with a step up regulator. Additionally I connected a pad for
Pin8/IO32/ADC4/TOUCH9. Haven't used it yet. Maybe for a touch wakeup or status
LED.

PCB can be ordered e.g. via aisler.net: https://aisler.net/p/HSIWEKKI
